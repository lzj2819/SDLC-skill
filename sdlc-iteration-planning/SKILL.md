# SDLC Iteration Planning

## Overview

Given an approved architecture and a new set of requirements, produce an incremental plan that adds to the existing system without invalidating prior design decisions. The core principle is: **the existing framework stays; only additions and targeted modifications are allowed**.

This skill performs impact analysis, writes an incremental PRD, updates architecture artifacts, and produces a step-by-step iteration plan.

## VCMF Checkpoints

| Principle | Checkpoint in this Skill |
|-----------|--------------------------|
| Design as Contract | New requirements must trace to existing PRD scope or be explicitly flagged as out-of-scope escalation |
| Interface as Boundary | Any interface change must be versioned; old interfaces remain compatible or have explicit migration path |
| Reality as Baseline | Impact analysis must identify every module affected by the new requirement; no hidden dependencies |
| State as Responsibility | New or modified state entries must declare their relationship to existing state (independent, derived, or replacement) |

## When to Use

- The user has completed initial scaffolding and wants to add new functionality
- The user says "I need to add...", "next version should include...", "can we also support..."
- Do NOT use if the user wants to redesign or refactor existing architecture (use `sdlc-architecture-design` instead)

## Precondition Check

Before starting, read `skill/artifacts/STATE.md` (or `docs/architecture/system/STATE.md`).
- Acceptable phases: `scaffolding_completed`, `module_design_completed`, `iteration_planning_completed`, `evolution_completed`
- If phase is earlier than `scaffolding_completed`, stop and instruct the user to complete prior phases first
- If `architecture.xml` is missing, stop — the system has no architecture baseline to increment upon

## Workflow

1. **Load full baseline**
   - Read `PRD.md` (existing requirements baseline)
   - Read `architecture.xml` (system-level architecture baseline)
   - Read `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` (existing I/O contracts)
   - Read `DECISION_LOG.md` (reasoning chain to preserve)
   - Read `STATE.md` (module registry, iteration history)
   - Read all existing `module-prd.md` files (if module-level designs exist)
   - Read `DESIGN_REVIEW.md` (known issues that might interact with new requirements)
   - Collect the user's new requirement description

2. **Scope validation**
   - Compare new requirements against the **Immutable Goal** in `STATE.md`
   - If new requirements fall outside the original scope boundary, flag as **scope escalation**
     - Ask user: "This requirement is outside the original scope boundary [quote boundary]. Do you want to: [A] Expand scope boundary and continue, [B] Defer to future project, [C] Treat as separate sub-project?"
   - If within scope, proceed

3. **Impact analysis**
   - For each new requirement, analyze its impact on the existing architecture:
     - **New module required?** → Mark as "add_module"
     - **Existing module needs new capability?** → Mark as "modify_module:{module_id}"
     - **Existing module interface needs extension?** → Mark as "extend_interface:{module_id}"
     - **Cross-module interaction changes?** → Mark as "modify_coupling"
     - **State model changes?** → Mark as "modify_state"
     - **No impact?** → Mark as "no_impact" (rare)
   - Produce an **Impact Matrix**:
     ```
     | Requirement | Affected Module | Impact Type | Severity |
     ```
   - Severity levels: `breaking` (changes existing interface), `additive` (new interface only), `internal` (module-internal only)

4. **Incremental PRD**
   - Write `ITERATION_PRD.md` containing ONLY the new/modified requirements:
     - For additive requirements: new user stories with `relates_to: US-XXX` linking to original PRD
     - For modified requirements: delta description (what changes, what stays the same)
     - Acceptance criteria for each new/modified user story
     - Explicit backward compatibility requirements if severity is `breaking`
   - Do NOT copy unchanged requirements from the original PRD

5. **Incremental architecture design**
   - For each "add_module" impact:
     - Treat as a new bounded context
     - Design module interface, coupling, and state ownership
     - Append new `Module` node to `architecture.xml`
     - Generate module XML template (same rules as `sdlc-architecture-design`)
   - For each "modify_module" or "extend_interface" impact:
     - Read the existing `module-architecture.xml` (or module template if not yet detailed)
     - Add new components or extend existing component interfaces
     - Update `module-interface-contract.md` with new methods
     - Update `component-spec.xml` templates for affected components
   - For each "modify_coupling" impact:
     - Update `Coupling` nodes in `architecture.xml`
     - Ensure no circular dependencies are introduced
   - For each "modify_state" impact:
     - Update `StateModel` in system XML and affected module XMLs
     - Document state migration strategy if existing state format changes

6. **XML synchronization**
   - Run `scripts/xml-sync.py --sync` (or simulate its logic) to propagate changes:
     - System-level interface changes → Module `Constraints`
     - Module-level component changes → Component `component-spec.xml` templates
     - New error codes → All relevant `ErrorCodes` and `ErrorHandling` nodes
   - Generate a **sync report** listing all files modified and changes made

7. **Interface versioning**
   - For any `breaking` severity change:
     - Increment the affected interface version (e.g., `v1.0` → `v1.1` or `v2.0`)
     - Document deprecation timeline for old interface if applicable
     - Update `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` with version history
   - For `additive` changes:
     - Append new methods/errors to existing interface sections
     - Mark with `[ADDED v1.1]` annotation

8. **Iteration plan generation**
   - Write `ITERATION_PLAN.md` containing:
     - Iteration goal (one sentence)
     - Scope summary (what's in, what's explicitly out)
     - Affected module checklist with required skill flows:
       ```
       | Module | Impact Type | Required Skills | Status |
       | UserService | extend_interface | design-review + scaffolding | pending |
       | PaymentService | add_module | requirement-analysis + architecture-design + ... | pending |
       ```
     - Execution order (dependencies between modules)
     - Human gate points
     - Risk summary (breaking changes, backward compatibility concerns)
     - Rollback criteria (when to abort the iteration)

9. **State update**
   - Update `STATE.md`:
     - Append to **Completed Steps**: `[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] sdlc-iteration-planning: Analyzed [N] new requirements. Impact: [X] modules affected. Iteration scope: [summary]`
     - Update **Current State**:
       - `phase: iteration_planning_completed`
       - `NextAction: iterate` (indicates we are in an iteration loop)
     - Update **Iteration History**: append new iteration entry with date, scope, and affected modules
     - Update **Module Registry**: add new modules with status `pending`; update affected modules' status if they change
     - Append iteration-specific risks to **Known Pitfalls**

10. **Human gate**
    - Present iteration summary:
      - Number of new requirements
      - Impact matrix (modules affected, severity)
      - Execution order and estimated skill flow
    - Say exactly: "迭代计划已生成。本次迭代涉及 [N] 个模块，其中 [X] 个新增、[Y] 个修改。请确认当前阶段输出。回复 [APPROVE] 按迭代计划逐个模块实施，回复 [MODIFY] 调整迭代范围，回复 [REJECT] 放弃本次迭代。"
    - Do NOT proceed until [APPROVE]

## Output Specification

- `skill/artifacts/ITERATION_PRD.md` (or `docs/architecture/system/ITERATION_PRD.md`)
- `skill/artifacts/ITERATION_PLAN.md` (or `docs/architecture/system/ITERATION_PLAN.md`)
- Updated `architecture.xml` with new/modified modules, interfaces, and couplings
- Updated `INTERFACE_CONTRACT.md` with versioned interface changes
- Updated module-level XML files for affected modules
- Sync report documenting all propagated changes

## Red Flags

- Do NOT modify existing architecture decisions in `DECISION_LOG.md` (append only)
- Do NOT change the core framework pattern (e.g., microservice → monolith) in an iteration
- Do NOT skip impact analysis — every new requirement must have a traced impact
- Do NOT ignore breaking changes — they must be explicitly versioned and communicated
- Do NOT proceed without the human gate
